"""
Inversion count represents how far or close a list is from being sorted.
If a list is sorted, the inversion count will be 0.
But if itâ€™s sorted in the reverse order, the inversion count will be maximum.

Consider indices i and j, such that i < j and lst[i] > lst[j], then there is an inversion in the list.
