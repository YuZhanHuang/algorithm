## Advantages
The good thing about the Brute Force method is that, 
if a solution to our problem exists, we are guaranteed to find the solution this way. 
Once we have a way to go about solving the issue, we can focus on making the solution more efficient.

## Disadvantages
Even through it might be the first solution that pops up into our heads, 
it is the most inefficient one. Also, there are no shortcuts and no performance improvements at this stage.
