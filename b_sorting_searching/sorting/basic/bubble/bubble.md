## Bubble Sort

### Overview
This is another famous sorting algorithm also known as **sinking sort**. 
It works by comparing adjacent pairs of elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
This is repeated until the list is sorted.

Think of it this way: a bubble passes over the list, **catches** the maximum/minimum element, 
and brings it over to the right side.


### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is O(n^2). Again, this algorithm is not very efficient.
