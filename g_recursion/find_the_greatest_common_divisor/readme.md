# Find the Greatest Common Divisor

## Problem Statement
Implement a function that takes two numbers, testVariable1 and testVariable2 and returns their greatest common divisor.

## What is the Greatest Common Divisor?
The Greatest Common Divisor of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.

For example, take two numbers 42 and 56 .

42 can be completely divided by 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.

56 can be completely divided by 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 56.

Therefore the greatest common divisor of 42 and 56 is 14 .
