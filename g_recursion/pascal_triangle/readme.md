# Pascal's Triangle

## Problem Statement
Implement a function that takes a number testVariable and returns the row of the Pascal’s triangle corresponding with that number.


## What is Pascal’s Triangle?
Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients.

To build Pascal’s Triangle we start with 1 at the top, then continue placing numbers below it in a triangular pattern. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

## Input
```
5
```

## output
```
[1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]
